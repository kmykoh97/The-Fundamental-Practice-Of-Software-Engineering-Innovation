### Introduction 
ReactJS is the new technology for web and mobile development introduced by Facebook. It is now a famous library that would allow for building a responsive and intuitive web interface with JavaScript.

### Advantages  
- Virtual DOM in ReactJS makes user experience better and developer’s work faster.
> The team behind React managed to increase the speed of updates by using virtual DOM. It updates even minimalistic changes applied by the user, but doesn’t affect other parts of interface.

- Permission to reuse React components significantly saves time
> Managing updates is easy for developers because all ReactJS components are isolated and change in one doesn’t affect others.

- One-direction data flow in ReactJS provides a stable code
> ReactJS allows for direct work with components and uses downward data binding to ensure that changes of child structures don’t affect their parents. That makes code stable. To change an object, all a developer needs to do is modify its state and apply updates. Correspondingly, only allowed components will be upgraded.

- An open-source Facebook library: constantly developing and open to the community
> ReactJS was one of the first open source JavaScript-connected project. This means a lot of useful applications and additional tools from off-company developers.

### Disadvantages  
- High pace of development
> The environment constantly changes, and developers must regularly relearn the new ways of doing things. Everything is evolving, and some developers are not comfortable with keeping up with such a pace.

- Poor Documentation
> The problem with documentation traces back to constant releases of new tools.

- Additional SEO hassle
> There have been concerns that Google and other search engines can’t index or poorly index dynamic web pages with client-side rendering. These concerns haven’t been fully proven and there are debunking materials around. Google itself confirmed back in 2014 that their crawlers are capable of reading dynamic content. So, we aren’t gonna say that your ReactJS app won’t be indexed by Google. It’s 2018 after all.



### Installation
To add in HTML script file:  
[click here](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-react-in-one-minute)  

To install using [npm package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/):  
```shell
First:
npm install -g create-react-app

Then:  
create-react-app hello-world
cd /hello-world

npm start
```
create-react-app is a package that we can find in NPM and that will make our life easier. It takes care of every configuration. We only need to use it. [^1]
