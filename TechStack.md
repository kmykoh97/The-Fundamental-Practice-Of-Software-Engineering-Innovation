## Native Apps vs. Web Apps: What is the Better Choice?

### Introduction

A Native App is an app developed essentially for one particular mobile device and is installed directly onto the device itself. Users of native apps usually download them via app stores online or the app marketplace, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play store and so on. An example of a native app is the Camera+ app for Apple’s iOS devices.

A Web App, on the other hand, are basically Internet-enabled apps that are accessible via the mobile device’s Web browser. They need not be downloaded onto the user’s mobile device in order to be accessed. The Safari browser is a good example of a mobile Web app.

### Comparison

- User Interface

  > From the point of the mobile device user, some native and Web apps look and work much the same way, with very little difference between them. The choice between these two types of apps has to be made only when you have to decide whether to develop a user-centric app or an application-centric app. Some companies develop both native and Web apps, so as to widen the reach of their apps, while also provide a good overall user experience.

- Accessibility

  > A native app is totally compatible with the device’s hardware and native features, such as an accelerometer, camera and so on. Web apps, on the other hand, can access only a limited amount of a device’s native features.

  While a native app works as a standalone entity, the problem is that the user has to keep downloading updates. A Web app, on the other hand, updates itself without the need for user intervention. However, it necessarily needs to be accessed via a mobile device’s browser.

- Efficiency

  > Native apps are more expensive to develop. However, they are faster and more efficient, as they work in tandem with the mobile device they are developed for. Also, they are assured of quality, as users can access them only via app stores online.

  Web apps may result in higher costs of maintenance across multiple mobile platforms. Also, there is no specific regulatory authority to control quality standards of these apps. The Apple App Store, though, features a listing of Apple’s Web apps.

### Can we get the best of both world?

As we can see, Native apps can provide optimized performance and take advantage of the latest technology, such as a GPS, compared to web apps or mobile cloud apps developed to be generic across multiple systems.

Due to the pros and cons offered by both different technology stack, we can't really decide which is the best among these 2 types of technology.

## Hybrid apps

### What is Hybrid Apps?

A hybrid app is a program that is built using HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript and wrapped in native container. The native container loads maximum information on the page as soon as the user navigates the application. There are plenty of native web frameworks available, which can help you build a hybrid app.

The main features of a typical hybrid app are:

- Faster app development
- Simple and easy to maintain
- Cross platform UI
- Integrate with device file system
- Less expensive app development and cost effective maintenance
- Single code management for multiple mobile platforms

However, like most technology stack, there must be some disadvantages drawing us back from it:

- Dependent on middleware (PhoneGap, Ionic, etc)
- Middleware may be slow to update
- Some bug fixes require middleware updates
- Some bug fixes are outside of your control
- Slower performance
- Less interactive than native apps
- More issues from devices fragmentation

### Why Hybrid Apps?

Hybrid mobile application development looks appealing to an organization’s bottom line. Why hire a developer for each platform when you can hire one developer and target all of them through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Well, the reality is a bit more complicated.

Yes, it’s true that hybrid mobile application development enables developers to target more than one platform. However, each platform comes with a set of caveats when it comes to its web runtime or WebView. This is especially true with Android, which is inconsistent between OS versions.

If you wish to target more than one platform, you have a number of choices. Clearly, the web offers a highly attractive solution for this requirement. Your target is the mobile browser. Hybrid lends itself well to this approach as well because of its reliance upon the WebView.

## Conclusion

Native and Hybrid Applications have their own pros and cons as we have already discussed. The decision about the choice of app depends largely on your requirement.

One of the most important steps in mobile app development is deciding on the approach you will be using. So, how do you decide between native, hybrid and web app development?
